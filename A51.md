Assignment 5 task 1 submitted by Timofei Podkorytov for the Operating systems course in fall 2024.

Here is the specification provided from the task:
```
void machine(void)
{
	loop {
		dispense_drink();// dispenses a single drink
	}
}
void student(void)
{
	insert_coin();// inserts a single coin
	pickup_drink();// pickup a dispensed drink	
}
void supplier(void)
{
	load_drink();// load a single drink
	collect_coins();// collect the coins	
}
```

# My solution:
We need a struct to store all our data:

```
typedef struct Machine {
	int capacity;
	int price;
	int inserted;
	int coins
	int drinks;
	
	sem toStudent[]; //user machine communication
	sem toSupplier[2]; //communication with supplier
	sem mutexStudent; //mutual exclusion for the students
	sem machineState; //the number of coins can be changed by supplier and student
} Machine;
```

First we need the semaphore for machine state . This is needed because despite only 1 student using it at a time, the supplier can refill it and thus change the number of coins and drinks. We also need to impose mutual exclusion on students and be able to signal between different threads.
```
Machine machine;
machine.capacity=3;//we assume that they are set to an arbitrary number
machine.coins=0;
machine.price=4;
machine.inserted=0;
machine.drinks=0;

for(int i=0; i< 3 ; i++){
	init(machine.toStudent[i],0);
}
for(int i=0; i< 2 ; i++){
	init(machine.toSupplier[i],0);
}
init(&machine.mutexStudent, 1);
init(&machine.machineState, 1);
```

Now we can describe all functions, that are needed to operate the machine.
### Machine
First we check if there are any drinks and if we need to refill.

We need to wait for the user to insert enough coins into the machine. Here I used a signaling pattern. After that we mutually exclude any other entity that can change machine state when dispensing.

After we are done we signal back to the user that the drink is ready for pickup. 

```
void machine(Machine* machine)
{
	loop {
		if(machine->drinks==0){
			sem_post(&machine->toSupplier[0]);
			thread_start(supplier());
			sem_wait(&machine->toSupplier[1]);
		}
		sem_post(&machine->toStudent[0])
		//we wait fot the student to pay
		sem_wait(&machine->toStudent[1]);
		
		//only one subject can edit machine state
		sem_wait(&machine->machineState);
		dispense_drink();// dispenses a single drink
		machine->coins+=machine->price;
		machine->inserted=0;
		machine->drinks--;
		sem_post(&machine->machineState);
		
		//we tell the person that the drink was dispensed
		sem_post(&machine->toStudent[2]);
		
	}
}
```

### Student
Here we need to pay attention that only one student use the machine at ounce. Also, only 1 subject at a time can change the total number of coins in the machine. This is why I used mutual exclusion on students and machine state.

Like in the machine I followed a signaling pattern in order to communicate with it.
```
void student(Machine* machine)
{
	//only 1 student at a time.We allow 1 student to proceed
	sem_wait(&machine->mutexStudent);
	sem_wait(&machine->toStudent[0])
	
	//we are editing machine state
	sem_wait(&machine->machineState);
	for(i = 0; i<machine->price;i++){//we need enough coins
		insert_coin();// inserts a single coin
		machine->inserted++;
	}
	sem_post(&machine->machineState)

	//the student have payed
	sem_post(&machine->toStudent[1]);
	
	sem_wait(&machine->toStudent[2]);
	pickup_drink();// pickup a dispensed drink
	
	//the next student can proceed
	sem_post(&machine->mutexStudent);
}
```
### Supplier
Supplier can change the number of drinks and also they take the coins that have accumulated. Thus we need a lock on machine state.
```
void supplier(Machine* machine)
{
	sem_wait(&machine->toSupplier[0]);
	sem_wait(&machine->machineState);
	for(int i=0;i<machine->capacity;i++){
		load_drink(); // load a single drink
	}
	machine->drinks=machine->capacity;
	collect_coins(); // collect the coins
	machine->coins=0;
	sem_post(&machine->machineState);
	sem_post(&machine->toSupplier[1]);
}
```
